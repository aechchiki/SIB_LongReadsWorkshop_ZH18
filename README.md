# Long Reads Workshop, Zurich 2018

This is a place of development of materials for the long read workshop organised by Patricia Palagi within
Training mission of [Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss/training).

#### Development of materials

- The text of the practicals will be in the [wiki of this repository](https://github.com/aechchiki/SIB_LongReadsWorkshop_ZH18/wiki).
This organization will allow to move details to separated cross-linked pages and to keep the main page of practicals clear and non-polluted by details.
- This repository should serve mainly for testing, but also for the record of downloaded data, all the scripts, etc.
- You can add here figures (preferably `png` format) that can be linked from wiki, also some SMALL datasets
- You should NOT add here bigger data, pdfs, or other stuff that is not very useful to version
- Do not hesitate to use issues.
