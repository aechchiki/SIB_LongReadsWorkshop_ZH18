# Introduction

## Vim basics


Vim comes in two modes: 

- "command"
- "insert"

 You can distinguish these modes by the footer at the very bottom of your file - it will display `-- INSERT --` if you are in "insert" mode. 

All you need to keep in mind for this tutorial is the following:

- you should use "insert" mode to modify your file content, and "command" mode to save the file and exit the editor
- to enter the insert mode, press `i`: this allows you to insert text at the cursor position
- to delete text when in insert mode, just press `return` key (as you would normally do on a GUI editor)
- to exit the insert mode, press `esc` key - you are now in command mode
- to save the file in command mode, type: `:w`
- to save the file and quit the editor in command mode, type: `:wq!`
